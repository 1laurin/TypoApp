As the hours passed, footage appeared showing the moment Ramallah-based journalist Mohammed Farra learned that his wife and children were all killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza\u2019s Khan Younes neighborhood.\u00a0\nSimilarly heart-rending scenes would play out more than once over the course of the day. Elsewhere in the besieged coastal enclave, an Israeli airstrike killed the wife, son, daughter and infant grandson of Al Jazeera Arabic\u2019s Gaza bureau chief, Wael Dahdouh.\nAljazeera' s brave veteran journalist Wael Dahdouh's wife, son and daughter were killed in an Israelis airstrike which targeted a shelter house they had fled to. Wael received the news while on air covering the nonstop Israeli strikes on Gaza! pic.twitter.com/yT7jYdG8jn\n\u2014 Mohamed Moawad (@moawady) October 25, 2023\n\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Palestinian journalists came hours after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured \u201cAmerican Jewish community leaders\u201d that he urged Qatar\u2019s government \u201cto tone down Al Jazeera\u2019s rhetoric about the war in Gaza\u201d during a recent trip to Doha. \nSuspicions that Israeli forces deliberately targeted Dahdouh\u2019s family were quickly bolstered by comments from News 13 journalist Zvi Yehezkeli.\u00a0\n\u201cGenerally we know the target,\u201d Yehezkeli told audiences within hours of the strike, adding, \u201cfor example, today there was a target: the family of an Al Jazeera reporter.\u201d\n\u201cIn general, we know,\u201d he concluded.\nChannel 13 journalist Zvi Yehezkeli admits Israel purposefully and premeditatedly murdered the family of Al Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh: \u201cGenerally we know the target. For example, today there was a target: the family of an Al Jazeera reporter. In general, we know.\u201d https://t.co/sOJk8uNMMc\n\u2014 David Sheen (@davidsheen) October 26, 2023\n\nIf true, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the Dahdouh\u2019s outlet found itself in Israeli crosshairs. In 2021, the Israeli military leveled the Gaza tower that housed the officers of both the Associated Press and Al Jazeera. The following year, Israeli forces assassinated renowned Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu-Akleh, a veteran Jerusalem-based correspondent for Al Jazeera, in a shooting that drew international condemnation but was largely ignored by the US government, which echoes the Israeli government\u2019s position that her killing was \u201cunintentional.\u201d Under Blinken, the State Department has distanced itself from its initial expressions of outrage and no longer calls for either an independent investigation or criminal charges for the perpetrators.\nAs the US and Israel rush to censor the voice of Palestinian journalists, Big Tech censorship has proven indispensable to Israel\u2019s propaganda war. In the aftermath of October 7, multiple social media platforms have suspended or deactivated profiles belonging to numerous prominent journalists, human rights advocates, and Palestinian activists. The crackdown follows years of complaints alleging double standards when it comes to anti-Zionist content on social media.\nAccounts operated by Eye On Palestine disappeared from Instagram, Facebook, and X on October 25, leaving more than 6 million followers unable to access one of the most popular resources providing firsthand footage of destruction in Gaza. A spokesman for Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, insisted the suspensions were not politically motivated, asserting \u201cWe did not disable these accounts because of any content they were sharing.\u201d\nDespite Meta\u2019s denial, it is worth recalling the company\u2019s record of complying with Israeli government censorship requests. Following the approval of a so-called \u201cFacebook Bill\u201d aimed at clamping down on digital \u201cincitement\u201d in 2016, fanatical former Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked bragged that Facebook, Twitter and Google were complying with 70 percent of their takedown orders.\nTamer Al Mishal, a Palestinian journalist who has served as a crucial Gaza-based news source for many years, put a face to that statistic. In September, Al Mishal made waves when he published an expos\u00e9 on Al Jazeera illustrating how Meta coordinated with Israeli intelligence to stifle pro-Palestinian content. When he attempted to access his social media profile days later, the reporter made an alarming discovery: his Facebook page had completely ceased to exist.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one. The week before, Meta suspended the Instagram account of Palestinian influencer and photojournalist Motaz Azaiza after he shared footage of the remnants of his apartment building, where 15 of his family members were killed in an Israeli airstrikes.\u00a0\n\u201cPalestinian journalists in Gaza are not just facing the Israeli occupation,\u201d Shadi Abdelrahman, a local reporter with years of experience covering events in Gaza from the ground, explained to The Grayzone. \u201cThey also have to overcome a lot of censorship by Facebook, YouTube,\u201d he told The Grayzone, adding: \u201canything on social media, they need to be very careful because they will get their accounts banned.\u201d\n\u201cWorking as a journalist in Gaza is not an easy job,\u201d he says, not only \u201cbecause you are being censored by social media, [but] also it can cause problems with Israeli authorities, especially if you\u2019d like to leave through any crossing which is controlled by Israel.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re outspoken in your coverage, Abdelrahman says, Israeli authorities \u201cwill consider you as an enemy.\u201d\nDuring 2021\u2019s Great March of Return, \u201cthose journalists who were attending the weekly marches and covering it were targeted deliberately by Israel.\u201d\n\u201cSome of them were shot in the knees, some of them were shot in the legs. Some of them got killed,\u201d Abdelrahman recalled.\nOn Instagram, meanwhile, users noted an apparent \u2018glitch\u2019 temporarily translated the Arabic word for \u201cPalestinian\u201d into \u201cPalestinian terrorist.\u201d\nDuring an October 26 raid in Jenin, the Israeli army destroyed the memorial to Shireen Abu Akleh, the renowned Al Jazeera correspondent it killed there a year before.\n Al JazeeraGazaGaza StripIsraelIsrael-PalestinemediaPalestineWael Dahdouh\nWyatt Reed is a correspondent and managing editor of The Grayzone.
